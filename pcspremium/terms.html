    TERMS OF SERVICE

PCSpeaker Premium

Last Updated: February 23, 2026

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the PCSpeaker Premium mobile application ("the App"). By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

1. Nature of the Software as a Utility Tool
PCSpeaker Premium is a software utility tool only.

•        No Platform Provided: The Developer does not provide, manage, or operate a content platform, server infrastructure, or media hosting service.

•        Local Functionality: The App is a tool designed to facilitate the playback of audio from a user's own personal computer to their mobile device via a local network or user-configured connection.

•        User-Operated: All audio transmission is initiated, controlled, and managed entirely by the user. The Developer has no access to, or knowledge of, the audio data being played.

2. Prohibited Use & DRM Compliance
You agree to use the App only for lawful, personal purposes.

•        DRM Restriction: You are strictly prohibited from using the App to record, capture, intercept, or redistribute any content protected by Digital Rights Management (DRM) or other technical protection measures.

•        Copyright Compliance: You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to access and play any audio processed through the App. The App is intended for personal "place-shifting" of legally acquired content, subject to your local jurisdiction's fair use/fair dealing laws.

•        Global Compliance: For users outside the United States, we comply with applicable local copyright laws and will cooperate with legitimate takedown requests from any jurisdiction.

3. Replay Buffer Feature
The Replay Buffer feature provides a temporary personal audio buffer for immediate personal replay of audio you are legally entitled to access.

•        Private Storage: Replay buffers are stored in private, isolated app storage inaccessible to other applications.

•        No Export or Sharing: Replay buffers cannot be shared, exported, or transferred to any other application or device.

•        Default Auto-Delete: By default, the buffer is automatically deleted upon first full playback. Users may explicitly choose to retain the buffer within the app for personal convenience; however, such retained buffers remain confined to the app's private storage.

•        User Responsibility Upon Save: Any decision to retain a Replay buffer beyond the default auto-delete is made solely by the user and is solely the user's legal responsibility.

•        Prohibited Use of Replay: Use of the Replay feature to capture, retain, or reproduce DRM-protected or copyrighted content is strictly prohibited.

4. No Liability for User Misuse
•        Neutral Utility: As the App is a neutral utility tool, the Developer does not monitor or control the audio content selected by the user.

•        Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Developer shall not be held liable for any legal claims, copyright infringement, or damages arising from how you choose to use this software. You assume all risk for the audio you choose to play from your PC to your mobile device.

5. No Warranty
The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The Developer does not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.

6. Age Requirement
The App is intended for users aged 13 and older. By using the App, you represent that you are at least 13 years of age. Users in the European Economic Area must be at least 16 years of age. The Developer does not knowingly collect information from children below the applicable minimum age.

7. DMCA Safe Harbor & Takedown Policy
Although the Developer does not host content, we comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

•        Designated Agent: If you believe your copyright is being infringed through the use of this software, please contact our Designated Agent at: tech@tiantucorp.com.

•        Notice Requirements: A formal notice must follow the format provided in Exhibit A (attached below).

8. Repeat Infringer Policy
The Developer maintains a policy for terminating the license of any user deemed a "repeat infringer."

•        Termination: Any user for whom the Developer receives two (2) or more valid DMCA takedown notices within a twelve (12) month period will have their Firebase account access and license to use the App revoked.

•        Discretion: The Developer reserves the right to terminate access immediately if the infringement is deemed willful or commercial in nature.

9. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Developer from any third-party claims, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your misuse of the software or your violation of intellectual property rights.

10. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Georgia, United States. Any legal action must be brought in the courts located within that jurisdiction.

11. Severability
If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

12. Modification of Agreement
•        The Developer reserves the right to modify, update, or change these Terms at any time and at our sole discretion.

•        Notice of Changes: We will notify you of material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document or via a notice within the App.

•        Acceptance: Your continued use of the App following the posting of any changes constitutes your formal acceptance of the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must cease all use of the App and uninstall it from your devices.

13. Acknowledgment

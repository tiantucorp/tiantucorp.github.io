<h2>Bible Daily Notes</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Bible is my Daily Light. With this Daily Notes App, I am able to bookmark my favorable verses, and write notes of my daily enlightenment at the right verses for future reference. I am also able to read my Bible versions, regardless of online/offline. Compared to other Bible software, it supports Bookmarks and Notes, Multi-Books, Multi-Versions, Search-by-Book, Multi-Languages, and Multi-Devices.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">1) Bookmarks and Notes. Bible is my Daily Light. With this Daily Notes App, I am able to bookmark my favorable verses, and write notes of my daily enlightenment at the right verses for future reference. Multimedia notes are supported, including Text, Hyperlink, Image, Audio and Video.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">2) Multi-Books. I am able to open multiple books at the same time. In case I am reading one of the Gospel book, I may want to cross-check how other Gospel books describe the same event. With Daily Notes, I will not lose my spot on the Gospel book I start with.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">3) Multi-Versions. I am able to open multiple versions at the same time. In case I am reading one book in Chinese, I may want to cross-check how other versions translate the same word. With Daily Notes, I will not lose my spot on the book I start with.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">4) Search-by-Book. Daily Notes presents Bible by Book instead of Chapter. It gives readers a sense of complete Book, and helps readers to do keyword search easily.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">5) Multi-Languages. Multiple language user interface, English and Chinese for now. In addition, Bible versions of English(NIV) and Chinese(CUV, CUVS) are embedded. Other language versions might be supported in the future. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">6) Multi-Devices. I am able to continue read my Bible version from a different device. In case I am reading Bible in online mode, I may continue to read from a different device. With Daily Notes, I will not lose my spot on the book I start with.</p>

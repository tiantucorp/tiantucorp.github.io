<h2>Bible Dailylight</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px">Bible Dailylight is for you to read your Bible versions, regardless of online/offline. Compared to other Bible software, it supports Multi-Books, Multi-Versions, Search-by-Book, Multi-Languages, and Multi-Devices.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">1) Multi-Books. You are able to open multiple books at the same time. In case you are reading one of the Gospel book, you may want to cross-check how other Gospel books describe the same event. With Dailylight, you will not lose your spot on the Gospel book you start with.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">2) Multi-Versions. You are able to open multiple versions at the same time. In case you are reading one book in Chinese, you may want to cross-check how other versions translate the same word. With Dailylight, you will not lose your spot on the book you start with.&nbsp; </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">3) Search-by-Book. Dailylight presents Bible by Book instead of Chapter. It gives readers a sense of complete Book, and helps readers to do keyword search easily.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">4) Multi-Languages. Multiple language user interface, English and Chinese for now. In addition, Bible versions of English(NIV) and Chinese(CUV, CUVS) are embedded. Other language versions might be supported in the future. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">5) Multi-Devices. You are able to continue read your Bible version from a different device. In case you are reading Bible in online mode, you may continue to read from a different device. With Dailylight, you will not lose your spot on the book you start with.</p>
